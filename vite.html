        <h1>VITAMIN E</h1>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Consumers have long embraced the practice of taking large amounts of vitamin E, once touted as being able to boost sexual prowess and to prevent gray hair, wrinkles, and other signs of aging. Although many of these rumored benefits of vitamin E have never been supported by science, a growing body of research suggests that the nutrient may, in fact, be an important protector against chronic diseases associated with aging.</p>

        <h2>Forms of Vitamin E</h2>
        <p><b>Tocopherol:</b> The chemical name for vitamin E. There are four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta), but only alpha-tocopherol is active in the body.</p>
        <p><b>Tocotrienols:</b> Four compounds (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) chemically related to tocopherol and tocopherols are collectively known as vitamin E.</p>
        <p><b>Lipid peroxidation:</b> Production of unstable, highly reactive lipid molecules that contain excess amounts of oxygen.</p>
        <p><b>Glutathione:</b> A tripeptide of glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid that is involved in protection of cells from oxidative damage.</p>

        <h2>Functions of Vitamin E</h2>
        <p>Vitamin E is an antioxidant and its activity is influenced by other nutrients involved in antioxidant pathways, such as vitamin C and selenium (a mineral). During normal metabolic processes, oxygen often reacts with other compounds to generate free radicals—highly unstable toxic molecules that contain one unpaired electron.</p>
        <p>Its main role is to act as an antioxidant, scavenging loose electrons—so-called “free radicals”—that can damage cells. It also enhances immune function and prevents clots from forming in heart arteries. It helps keep the immune system strong against viruses and bacteria.</p>

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat germ oil</li>
            <li>Sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil</li>
            <li>Sunflower seeds</li>
            <li>Almonds</li>
            <li>Peanuts, peanut butter</li>
            <li>Beet greens, collard greens, spinach</li>
            <li>Pumpkin</li>
            <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deficiency of Vitamin E</h2>
        <p>In children and adults, fat-malabsorption disorders and subsequent vitamin E deficiency usually cause neurological problems that affect the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. In adults, malabsorption must be prolonged, from 5 to 10 years, before signs of deficiency surface.</p>

        <h2>Hemolysis</h2>
        <p>Hemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells that usually occurs at the end of a red blood cell’s normal life span. This process releases hemoglobin.</p>
