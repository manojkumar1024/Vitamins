    <h1>VITAMIN A</h1>

    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>Vitamin A, a vital nutrient for human health, plays a crucial role in vision, immune function, cell growth, and reproduction. It exists in two forms: retinol, found in animal products, and carotenoids, found in plants. Deficiency can lead to vision problems, impaired immunity, and growth issues, while excessive intake may pose health risks. Incorporating vitamin A-rich foods like carrots, spinach, and liver into oneâ€™s diet is essential for maintaining optimal health.</p>

    <h2>FUNCTIONS OF VITAMIN A</h2>

    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> It is essential for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low light conditions. It helps form the light-sensitive cells in the retina.</p>
    <p><strong>Immune function:</strong> Vitamin A supports the immune system by helping maintain the integrity of the skin and mucous membranes, which act as barriers to infection.</p>
    <p><strong>Reproduction and growth:</strong> It is important for normal growth and development, including the development of bones and teeth, as well as reproductive processes.</p>
    <p><strong>Cellular communication:</strong> Vitamin A plays a role in cell growth and differentiation, which is important for maintaining the health of various tissues and organs in the body.</p>
    <p><strong>Gene expression:</strong> It is involved in regulating the expression of certain genes, which can influence various physiological processes.</p>
    <p><strong>Antioxidant activity:</strong> Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals.</p>

    <h2>SOURCES OF VITAMIN A</h2>

    <p>Leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach, broccoli), orange and yellow vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin and other winter squash, summer squash)</p>

    <h2>DEFICIENCY</h2>

    <p>Dry Skin: Vitamin A is responsible for creating and repairing skin cells. Eczema and other skin problems are caused due to vitamin A deficiency that leads to dry, itchy skin.</p>
    <p>Dry eyes: Eye problems are related to vitamin A deficiency. The inability to produce tears is the first sign of vitamin A deficiency.</p>
    <p>Night Blindness: Acute vitamin A deficiency results in night blindness. Vitamin A supplements have helped women adapt to darkness by 50% within six weeks.</p>
    <p>Infertility: Vitamin A deficiency results in infertility in both men and women. It is also beneficial for the proper development of babies. It also acts as an antioxidant that is required by infertile men due to oxidative stress in their bodies.</p>
    <p>Delayed Growth: Vitamin A is beneficial for the proper growth and development of the body. Deficiency of vitamin A results in stunted growth in children.</p>
