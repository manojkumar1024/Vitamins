        <h1>VITAMIN K</h1>

        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>Vitamin K is a family of compounds known as quinones.</p>
        <p><b>Phylloquinone:</b> The form of vitamin K that comes from plant sources. Also known as vitamin K1.</p>
        <p><b>Menaquinones:</b> Forms of vitamin K that come from animal sources. Also produced by intestinal bacteria, they are collectively known as vitamin K2.</p>
        <p><b>Menadione:</b> A medicinal form of vitamin K that can be toxic to infants. Also known as vitamin K3.</p>

        <h2>Functions of Vitamin K</h2>
        <p>The functions of vitamin K are primarily concerned with the blood clotting process. It brings about the translational (after protein synthesis in the cell) modification of certain blood clotting factors.</p>
        <p>The clotting factors II (Prothrombin), VII, IX, and X are synthesized as inactive precursors (zymogens), and vitamin K is important for the carboxylation of osteocalcin, allowing it to become saturated with carboxyl groups.</p>
        <p>Low levels of vitamin K are associated with low bone mineral density. Vitamin K is also involved in bone health and is essential for many steps in the blood clotting cascade of reactions.</p>

        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green leafy vegetables</li>
            <li>Spinach</li>
            <li>Soybean</li>
            <li>Egg yolks</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Liver</li>
            <li>Fish</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Cauliflower</li>
            <li>Meat</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deficiency of Vitamin K</h2>
        <p>Although vitamin K has a crucial role in blood clotting, the body needs only small amounts, making vitamin K deficiency rare in healthy adults. However, preliminary research suggests that typical diets supply less than optimal amounts for bone health. Low dietary vitamin K intake is associated with reduced bone density in women and has been linked to increased fracture risk.</p>
        <p>People who suffer from fat-malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease, sprue, cystic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease, can develop vitamin K deficiency. Prolonged use of antibiotics may cause a deficiency because the drugs can destroy the intestinal bacteria that produce vitamin K. Prior to surgery, a patient's vitamin K status is often tested to assess the risk for hemorrhaging because antibiotics are frequently part of the treatment regimen.</p>
